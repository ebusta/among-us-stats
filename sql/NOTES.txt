ALLOW REMOTE CONNECTIONS TO POSTGRESQL: 
	went to /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf , uncommented the line that said: listen_addresses = 'localhost' and changed the value to *
	then went to the pg_hba.conf file in the same directory and added this line at the bottom: host all all  0.0.0.0/0 md5

REBUILD DATABASE FROM BACKUP: 
	First you have to create the database if this isn't already done (likely manually). 
	psql <dbname> -f <filename> -1 -- not sure if <dbname> needs to be here

NOTE: catchAsync functions require next as a param. Is that why it was breaking on my app?

THOUGHTS: Maybe don't do 20mg of weed chocolate before programming. 
		  Also, need to be certain of the logic when creating stuff. 
			At first, a group is created. When you're creating a group, you have to either add new users or select existing users. 
			You can add users to a group, either existing ones or new ones. 
			There's no real management via users, only via groups. All you can really do is create a new player, but you never do anything just as a player afterwards. You have to go to the group to add an existing player in.
